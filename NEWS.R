\section{Changes in version 2.0 compared to version 1.*}{
  \itemize{
    \item The code has been streamlined.

    \item The first version accepted dates into Century Month Code or decimal years. Biograph now also accepts Gregorian calendar dates. The package includes several functions to convert one date format into another.

    \item The graphics is improved using the ggplot2 package.

    \item A distinction is made between Biograph functions and utilities used by Biograph functions. Utilities are generic. The package includes about 20 utilities. 

    \item With the publication of Version 2.0, a utility is distributed to assist the production of a Biograph object (in the doc subdirectory of the package). The code that applies the utility to different data sets is published too.
